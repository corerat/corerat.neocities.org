                Hello, welcome to my personal blog. here I manually create each blog entry.
                <br><br>
                My name is corerat, I used to be a self-proclaimed "audiovisual artist" who focused on making music using FL Studio.
                <br><br>
                I am 23 years old, I speak Spanish, English and Esperanto. I was born in south Mexico, but I will keep the exact location private.
                <br><br>
                I also had a fascination for many other things, I'd say I was someone very passionate on life. Now I only focus on thriving and succeeding.
                <br><br>
                I am a very curious person, I like to learn about many things, and I have a lot of hobbies. I am also a very creative person, and I like to express myself through art, music, and writing.
                <br><br>
                I have a wife, she is so beautiful and intelligent, I enjoy playing Dandy's World with her so muc because she's so good at it, and I am a tryhard on it.
                <br><br>
                My musical inspirations vary a lot, but some remarkable ones are (and I apologise for how goofy and random it can be): Boards of Canada, My Bloody Valentine, Merzbow, Brian Eno, TOBACCO, Black Moth Super Rainbow, Babymetal, lostrushi, joeyy, Dj Smokey, DJ Yung Vamp, Soudiere, Lil Ugly Mane, 4lung, lungskull, deafheaven, astrobrite, burzum, deli girls, takako minekawa, Thee Oh Sees, Spiritualized, Phantogram, Canserbero, Corvus Corax, MeNeO, The Smashing Pumpkins, Lush, Soto Asa, Cecilio G, Grimes, Ramleh, Pedro Ladroga, Marlon DuBois, Harto Falion, macintosh plus.
                <br><br>
                I love Dandy's World so much, I am so obsessed with it. I know all thhe stats of the toons, I know exactly how to make each toon work the best based on their stats, abilities and circumstances. I don't really care that people believe it's a "bad game", because it makes so happy I really don't care what do people think about it. I also like Sprunki.
                <br><br>
                I like HiFi music. I like animals. I like nature. I like cartoons.

                <br><br>
                my favorite linux distribution is arch linux, chimera linux and void linux. I also like freebsd and openbsd. I am a big fan of the BSD family of operating systems.
                <br><br>
                my native language is spanish, but I also speak english and esperanto. I am currently learning russian and german. I am also interested in learning other languages such as japanese, chinese, arabic, and many others.
